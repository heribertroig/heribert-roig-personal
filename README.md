# Heribert Roig - Portfolio Repository
This is a personal repository that I created when I started the nanodegree program in Data Science at Udacity.

The projects that I keep doing will be added in this repository


## Overview
This repository serves as a portfolio showcasing my data science and machine learning projects. Each project is organized into its own directory, containing code, documentation, and other relevant files.

## Installations
The repository uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and is configured with `pyproject.toml`. To install the dependencies, you need to install poetry and the run the poetry install, which will install all the libraries described in the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)
```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
```
In the pyproject.toml file, you can also find the python version used for this project (3.10.6).

## Projects

### Project 1: [Project 1: Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post](udacity_courses/project_1/)

### Project 3: [Disaster Response Pipeline Project](udacity_courses/project_3/)

## Getting Started
Each project directory contains its own README.md file with specific instructions on how to run the code, replicate the analysis, or explore the results. Follow the instructions in each project's README to get started.
